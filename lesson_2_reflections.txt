-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you first initialize a repository git creates a .git directory to store the meta data
you need to do it to make the directory a git repository to start tracking files.
-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
the staging area represents the files that changed and you want them to be committed together
because they represent one logical change. So it's the version that you want to be committed.
Once you're ready then you want to commit that in the repository.
the working directory is just the working directory.
