-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think using a remote repository comes in handy when collaborating with other developers.
It makes work a lot easier.
And it's a great way to publish your projects when you're done to share it with others to help them. And also so they can update
your version and contribute to it so the project get bigger and bigger.
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It can be pretty annoying if it automatically waste time to pull and push changes especially when changes
are big. Also you might not to pull some changes and you want to get more control.
