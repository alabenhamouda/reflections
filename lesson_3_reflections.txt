-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think using a remote repository comes in handy when collaborating with other developers.
It makes work a lot easier.
And it's a great way to publish your projects when you're done to share it with others to help them. And also so they can update
your version and contribute to it so the project get bigger and bigger.
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It can be pretty annoying if it automatically waste time to pull and push changes especially when changes
are big. Also you might not to pull some changes and you want to get more control.
-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of github repositories in github. It's related to the origin repository. We use to try changes on a github repository
and then we could suggest these changes to the author. Clones are copies of repositories locally. So you wanna clone a repo to 
work on it on your computer. Once you're done you can then push it to a remote repository to share it with people.
Lastly, branches are just one path in the commit history of a repository. Using it allow us to organize work and facilitate 
working on features especially collaborating.
-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare the your branch and the remote branch.
