-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think using a remote repository comes in handy when collaborating with other developers.
It makes work a lot easier.
And it's a great way to publish your projects when you're done to share it with others to help them. And also so they can update
your version and contibute to it so the project get bigger and bigger.
